Level Design Document Template


**This is the template for creating your own Level Design Document. As you go through the document.**


Concept Requirements


In this section you should include all the gameplay elements that you must achieve in this level.

* The levelhas a deadspace atmosphere and horrific environment.

* The player must look for flashlight, medpacks, and guns to survive.

* The player must have a monologue while looking out on the room window and seeing the chaos within the facility

* The player is introduced to the flashlight, throwable rocks, smoke, and knife then guns. To escape the facility and help other people in need.

* The player must be in possession of survival gear to survive beyond the facility.


Goals


**In this section you should include all the gameplay elements that would be good to achieve in this level, but are not critical.**


* The player should be able to perform stealth killing, firearm engagements, healing, and helping other people.

* The player should have more opportunities to master these gameplay mechanics.

* The level should impose a feeling of chaos and thriving for survival.


Game Context


**In this section you should include the greater gameplay context for the level, including important and relevant information about levels prior to and after this level.**


* This level continues the player’s investigation on what's happening around the facility whether its a dialogue or documents lying around the facility.

* The level provides pathing whether its misdirections or loops and branching in general.
  

Setting


**In this section you should describe the environment and setting for the level. Use relevant environment information from the Game Design Document.**


* The entire level takes place in research underground facility
     * Use assets from fab bought and saved in library paid and free.
* Lighting should be kept low and focused in important areas. Since there's a power outage and emergency lights running only around the facility and some fire pits from the destructiona and panic.


Time


**If your game has seasonal or day/night cycles, include the season and time of day the level should occur in.**

* Since the game is indoors there won't be any seasons at all unless the player escape then the player will see night time and fall season.

Metrics


**In this section you should indicate any major metrics difference from the Game Design Document guidelines. If there are no differences, just note that.**

* No difference at all since most of these mechanics are from the game design document also.

Player and player movement


**Note any changes to the player or player movement, e.g. extra jump height, increased health, etc.**


* The player should continue to suffer from exhaustion and trauma.


World

**Note any changes to the world, e.g. gravity changes, size differences, etc.**


* Multi linear level design of a narrow and ruined research facility.

Items


**Note any changes to items or item abilities, e.g. this level requires the use of a grappling hook, etc.**

* Backpack, smoke bombs, knives, guns, and grenades etc.


Narrative & Drama


Beat Chart


**In this section you should chart out the beats of the level, indicating any rising or falling drama.**


Explicit



**In this section you should indicate any narrative/plot elements that will be revealed to the player in a direct, explicit way.**

* The Player must observe the surroundings to understand the narrative of the game through talking to other survivors.
* The Player must be informed of certain equipments he can find and use against the infected and soldiers that killing everyone.


Implicit


**In this section you should indicate any narrative/plot elements that should be included in the level, but aren’t directly revealed to the player.**


* Research Area

  * Corpses should explain the situation and some whiteboard indicating what kinds of experiments they're working on.

  * There should be indications of a fire and destruction showing how everything is in ruins and chaos.

  * All facility rooms should indicate that a lot of people are dying and getting infected.

* Mainhall

  * Symbol of last stand where soldiers are still trying to contain the situation.

 
Narrative diagram


**In a complete Level Design Document, you might have a narrative diagram for the level. That is out of scope for this course, so this section can be left blank.**


Dialogue


**In a complete Level Design Document, you might have a complete script for the different dialogues in the level. That is out of scope for this course, so this section can be left blank.**


Mapping


Pathing diagram


**In this section you should create a pathing diagram, indicating the main nodes, zones, and pathways the players can traverse in the level.**

This level consists multi linear area where the player has the freedom whenever which path he chooses and which rooms he wants to enter.

Landmarks


**In this section you should list the important micro, meso, and macro landmarks in the level.**

* Macro: Research and surgery room

* Macro: Main hall

* Meso: Living quarters
  
* Micro: Door to other facilities


Level Map


**In this section you should include your proposed level map.**


Challenges & Rewards


**This is the section where you describe what the challenges are that face the player.**

* Fighting against infected and soldiers with limited ammunition and equipment.

Encounters


**Encounters are interactions that may or may not lead to combat or rewards, but do not have combat in them.**

**Puzzles are challenges that require mental deduction, and generally do not include combat.**


* Probably some valves to turn off when a gas is leaking and door needing to pry open.
